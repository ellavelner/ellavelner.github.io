		<h3>What makes a company more prone to illegal activities?</h3>
		<div class="stretch">
		<p>When looking at the probable legality of a company, you need to know what the indicators are that a company is not so legal. The main indicators that were used to make the model this website is based on are:
			<ul>
				<li>Do they have a website and what is on that website? Is it from a template or copy-pasted?  Then it’s probably fraud. Is there contact info available? How is that website ranked on Google? Valid companies try to be at the top, while fraudulent companies try to be invisible. Also, do they have a secure web address (HTTPS) or not? And is it frequently updated or not?</li>
				<li>Where is there company located and how far away is the correspondence address? If it’s far away, it might indicate shady business.</li>
				<li>Is the company a member of Fenex (the branch organization)? And if not, do they have an AEO (less control at the border)? If this last question is the case, this strongly suggests the company is taking part in illegal activities. </li>
			</ul>
		These indicators are then used for clustering the companies through a model, which results in three clusters:
			<ul>
				<li>Not suspicious</li>
				<li>A bit suspicious</li>
				<li>Highly suspicious</li>
			</ul>
		These clusters are the basis for the colored dots on the map (green, yellow, red).</p>
