							<h4 class="blogtitle">YRRSDS: Discussing the future of spoken dialog systems <span class="date">Friday 03-07-2020</span></h4>
							<div>
								<p><img class="blogimg" src="images/YRRSDS.png" alt="" />
								At the beginning of the week, I attended the Young Researchers Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yrrsds2020/" target="_blank">YRRSDS</a>). 
								Although it was virtual, and with only 14 participants, it was a very diverse workshop, with nice keynotes from Vivian Chen, 
								Amanda Stent and Casey Kennington, and discussions on user experience, multimodality, evaluation, architecture and transfer learning. 
								In this blogpost, I would like to tell you a bit about my personal highlights of the workshop.</p>
								
								<a onclick="getElementById('More').style.display = 'block'; this.style.display = 'none'"><i>Read more...</i></a>
								
								<div id="More" style="display:none">
									<h5>Keynotes</h5>
									<p>First of all, I would like to thank all keynote speakers. They were inspiring and to the point. The keynote that inspired me the most was that of <a href="https://www.caseyreddkennington.com/" target="_blank">Casey Kennington</a>. 
									Casey was also the host of SIGDIAL this year, which was the parent conference of YRRSDS. He specializes in spoken dialog systems for human-robot interaction. 
									This, of course, is a very interesting topic to me. He talked about incremental spoken dialog, which was new to me, but I'm glad I know of this strategy now. 
									I often run into this problem, where the robot takes its time to process the utterance of the user, and only after this is finished, the robot looks for the right way to respond.
									Incremental dialog would solve this problem. It could also help with predicting the end of a turn in the turn-taking system. If you want to read more about incremental dialog, I'd suggest you start
									<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7404864" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
									<p>Another topic of Kennington's talk was the necessity of embodiment in an interaction. He claims (and he is not alone) that we need the physical body to understand the semantics. 
									This is a huge affirmation for the need of HRI and to not only stay in the virtual realm, with chatbots and virtual agents. He also mentioned he was reading the book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/linguistic-bodies" target="_blank">Linguistic Bodies</a>, 
									which goes into detail about this theory. Needless to say, this book is now on my reading list.</p>
									<p>Since Casey also went to YRRSDS himself a couple of times, earlier in his career, he knew that we were all young researchers at the start of their career. Because of this, he dedicated a third of his talk to advise
									us on how to plan for the future. He gave us really hands-on tips about writing and networking that I'll take to heart. In the end, the whole talk really resonated with me, and I think what's always the most important 
									thing to accomplish in a keynote: it made me really enthousiastic about where I am, what I'm doing and who I'm meeting!</p>
									
									<h5>Discussions</h5>
									<p>The main goal of YRRSDS was to discuss about the common interests of the group. The organizers collected questions we had upfront. This way the discussion was easily moderated, and the questions evoked a lot of response. 
									I loved that I got the chance to talk about paralinguistic cues and the effects of them on the interaction, and the need to research the topic more. 
									I also learned about some corpora, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09977.pdf" target="_blank">MEENA</a> and <a href="http://workshop.colips.org/wochat/data/" target="_blank">WOCHAT</a>, although these are mainly interesting for me when I'm looking at the dialog management from the <a href="projects/enterface" target="_blank">eNTERFACE project</a>, since they are chatbot datasets.
									Another thing we talked about quite extensively, was how to improve user experience with a system that just isn't there yet to be 100% perfect. One of the options is to have a human assistant, who will be asked to join, if the system is getting stuck. 
									However, this means that it will just go back to human-human communication. A different solution, which we all agreed on, would be to let the user know when the system can't deal with the input and let the system tell the user that it's still learning and that maybe the user can help it improve. 
									This way the user's frustration or irritation can be acknowledged, which will lower the negative feelings, and it can make the user feel superior, since they might teach the system something. This could ignite positive feelings and thus improve the user experience.
									Alexa apparently already implemented something like this, where it will explain its mistakes.</p>

									<h5>Networking</h5>
									<p>Of course these workshops are not only about absorbing and discussing knowledge. I try to see every work event as a possibility to network (which was also part of the advice from Casey during his talk). 
									Beside the fact that I learned what other people in the field of spoken dialog systems are researching, I met one person of special interest to me: <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/computing/directory/student-directory/aprajita-shukla/" target="_blank">Aprajita Shukla</a>. She is working on an adaptive search tool for children (<a href="https://cast.boisestate.edu/about/" target="_blank">CAST</a>).
									Since we are both looking at how children perceive information and what language they use, and my fellow PhD student, Thomas Beelen, is looking into how critical children are towards the information they receive, Aprajita is someone I would like to stay in touch with. 
									We are already planning a brainstorm session where we'll share the knowledge we have and discuss how we might be able to help each other, so I'm looking forward to that!</p>
									
									<h5>Overall</h5>
									<p>In the end, the workshop exceeded my expectations. Since I'm technically not entirely in the spoken dialog system field of research and it was at UTC-6 times, which meant staying up late and two very long days of work, I was not that excited. 
									However, it turned out to be a very fruitful experience, and I got very enthousiastic about my research and that of others, and vice versa. I was reminded of the fact that I love having discussions with like-minded people about our research.
									So, I'll definitely participate in more of these events in the future. I'll keep you posted!

								<div>
									<p><img class="blogimg" src="images/hri2020.png" alt="" />
									In March I was supposed to present my work in Cambridge and go to my first conference. 
									Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the conference had to be held virtually, and therefore made my first conference a lot less exciting. 
									You can check out my presentation video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJM5lb2WfH8" target="_blank">here</a>. I did find out that we were nominated for Best Paper in User Studies!
									Especially since this was my first research paper, this felt as quite an accomplishment.</p>
